//Assume that you have two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. These numbers are added to produce s[7:0]. Also compute whether a (signed) overflow has occurred
//If inputs have the same sign but the sumâ€™s sign differs, overflow happened. If inputs have different signs, overflow cannot happen in two's complement addition.
